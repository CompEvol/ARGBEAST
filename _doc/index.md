Documentation Overview
======================

[Bacter](http://tgvaughan.github.io/bacter) is a [BEAST
2](http://www.beast2.org/) package dedicated to performing inference of
bacterial sequence data. In general, it allows for joint inference of
the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), recombination rates, tract
lengths, substitution rate and population dynamics. Exactly what may be
inferred from a given data set depends heavily on the size of the data
set, and the rates of recombination and mutation for the population
under study, and the sampling procedure.

The documentation for Bacter currently consists of:

1. the [installation instructions](installation.html), and
2. a [basic tutorial](basic_tutorial.html).

Please complete the tutorial before attempting to analyze your own data.
